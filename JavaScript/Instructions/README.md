#  JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background
The data used for this project is a collections of  eye-witness reports of UFO sighting. The goals  is to put this information online for the world to see. The code written will  create a table dynamically allows users to filter the table data for speific values


## Task

* Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided 

* Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Create a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Use a date form in  HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.


* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
